## Objective
The goal of this project was to practice playing with data structures. I find raw data, and try to model the data to fit in some combination of structures.

## Topic: Genome Data
The raw data was generously provided through The Harvard Personal Genome Project. I chose one from AncestryDNA that didn't have too much data: roughly 5MB.
