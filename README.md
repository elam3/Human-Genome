## Objective
The goal of this project was to practice playing with data structures.

Find raw data, and try to model the data to fit in some combination of structures.

## Topic: Genome Data
The raw data was generously provided through The Harvard Personal Genome Project. I chose one from AncestryDNA that didn't have too much data: roughly 5MB.

### Why are there 26 chromosomes?

The data includes the 22 autosomes, 23 is the X chromosome, 24 is a Y chromosome without the psuedoautosomoal region (PAR), 25 is the PAR from the Y chromosome, and 26 is the mitochondrial dna.
